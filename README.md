The purpose of a movie library is to organize movies in a way that makes it easy for users to search and retrieve information about specific movies.

Description of your movie library:
I have created a movie library in Java language, which allows users to add, delete, search, and display information about movies. 
The library is built using object-oriented programming principles and consists of several classes, including a Movie class that represents individual movies, 
and a Library class that manages the collection of movies.

The library has several features that make it user-friendly and efficient. 
Users can add movies to the library by providing the movie title, genre, director, and actors. 
They can also delete movies from the library by providing the movie title. 
The library provides a search function that allows users to search for movies by title, genre, director, or actors. 
The search function returns a list of all movies that match the search criteria. Finally, the library allows users to display information about all the movies in the library.

Benefits of your movie library:
My movie library provides several benefits to users. 
First, it allows users to organize their movie collections in a way that makes it easy to search and retrieve information about specific movies. 
Second, it saves users time and effort by automating the process of adding and deleting movies from the library. 
Third, it allows users to quickly find movies that match their interests by searching for movies by title, genre, director, or actors.
